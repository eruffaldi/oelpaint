# oelpaint

Web paint tool for my child, as a replacement for Tux Paint. Let explore both keyboard and mouse

# features

* svg
* undo

# ideas

* filling tool (in progress)
* background/foreground (easy)
* fillground: same as foreground but used as input for the filling (perfect filling coloring exercises)
* scenario: background, foreground, palette, tool.
* SVG export (easy)
* make the user interface progressive (simpler ... complex)
* allow changing color from the current color (e.g. darker/lighter)
* allow a pen-down mode (turle mode)
* parent mode gui
* MAYBE special cursor: http://codepen.io/satchmorun/pen/JoGVwb
